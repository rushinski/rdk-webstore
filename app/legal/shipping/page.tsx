            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">1) Processing Time (When We Ship)</h2>
            <p>
              We aim to ship orders within 24 hours of the order being placed, unless stated otherwise, and
              provided no unforeseen events occur that prevent shipment in that timeframe.
            </p>
            <p>Important clarifications:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
              <li>&quot;Within 24 hours&quot; refers to processing time, not delivery time.</li>
              <li>Processing time may be measured in business hours and may be affected by weekends and holidays.</li>
              <li>Some orders may require additional time for verification (for example, fraud prevention or address confirmation).</li>
            </ul>

              <li>holidays or weekends</li>
              <li>weather events or natural disasters</li>

            <p>
              Shipping options and rates are displayed at checkout. The shipping method you choose affects transit
              time, not our processing time.

          <section>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">4) Tracking</h2>
            <p>
              When available, we will provide tracking information once your order ships. Tracking updates may take
              time to appear after carrier acceptance.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">5) Delivery Times and Carrier Responsibility</h2>
            <p>
              Delivery dates are estimates and are not guaranteed. After a package is handed to the carrier,
              delivery speed and handling are the carrier&apos;s responsibility (except where applicable law provides
              otherwise).

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">6) Address Accuracy</h2>
            <p>
              You are responsible for providing a complete and accurate shipping address at checkout. If an order
              is returned or delayed due to an incorrect or incomplete address, additional shipping charges may
              apply to reship.
