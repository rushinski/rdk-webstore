# .vercel Directory

This directory remains empty in the repository.

Vercel CLI reads `.vercel/project.json` to determine which Vercel 
project a deployment belongs to. CI dynamically injects the correct
project.json for Staging or Production during the workflow.

Do not add project.json to version control.
